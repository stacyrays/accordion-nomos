    <h1>About NOMOS</h1>
    <p>
      In 1958, Harvard University Press published the first volume of NOMOS, the
      yearbook of the American Society for Political and Legal Philosophy.
      Edited by Carl Friedrich, and entitled Authority, it began a series of
      annual volumes published or currently in production. These thematic
      collections have been staples of political and legal philosophical
      scholarship and in many cases have become the first place for scholars to
      turn on any given theme. The essays continue to be a valuable resource for
      interdisciplinary research and undergraduate and graduate education. The
      volumes from 1977 (NOMOS XVII) to 2017 (NOMOS LVIII) are available on
      JSTOR. (There is generally a two- to three-year lag between publication of
      the volumes by New York University Press and when they become available on
      JSTOR.)
